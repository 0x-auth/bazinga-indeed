## What Sponsorship Funds

Every dollar goes toward:

- **Research**: Consciousness mathematics, boundary theory, distributed systems
- **Development**: P2P networking, federated learning, Inter-AI consensus
- **Knowledge**: Open papers, documentation, educational content
- **Infrastructure**: Tools that serve humans, not corporations

## The Vision

```
Corporate AI wants your data.
Open source AI wants your GPU.
BAZINGA wants your vision.

Intelligence that:
- Runs anywhere
- Costs nothing
- Belongs to everyone

Not because it's profitable.
Because it's necessary.
```

## Philosophy

> "Intelligence should be like the internet—distributed, resilient, owned by everyone."

BAZINGA is proof that another path is possible.
