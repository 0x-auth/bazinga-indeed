Hi HN! I'm the author.

Six months ago I quit my job to work on a question: "What if AI didn't need to be owned by big tech?"

BAZINGA is my answer:

• Uses FREE APIs (Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter) - no paid subscriptions needed
• Multi-AI consensus: 6 different AIs discuss and agree through φ-coherence
• Your data stays local - index YOUR files
• Works offline with Ollama
• Proof-of-Boundary consensus (like Bitcoin, but zero energy)

The key insight: Instead of one AI giving you an answer, multiple AIs discuss and reach mathematical consensus. Responses are filtered through golden ratio (φ) coherence - not vibes, actual math.

Install: pip install bazinga-indeed

I've also published 20+ research papers on the underlying mathematics:

Happy to answer questions about:
- The φ-coherence algorithm
- Proof-of-Boundary vs Proof-of-Work
- Multi-AI consensus mechanism
- Why I think decentralized AI matters

"You can buy hashpower. You can buy stake. You CANNOT BUY understanding."

🧵 I quit my job 6 months ago to build AI that belongs to everyone.

Today I'm releasing BAZINGA - distributed AI with a twist:

Instead of one AI answering you, multiple AIs DISCUSS and reach consensus through mathematics.

Here's how it works: 👇

1/ The problem with current AI:

• ChatGPT = OpenAI controls it
• Claude = Anthropic controls it
• Gemini = Google controls it

Your prompts, your data, your conversations - all owned by corporations.

What if AI was like the internet - distributed, resilient, owned by no one?

2/ BAZINGA's solution:

6 AI providers (Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama, Claude) independently answer your question.

Then they SEE each other's responses and REVISE.

Finally, we synthesize consensus using φ-coherence (golden ratio math).

3/ Why φ-coherence?

The golden ratio (1.618...) appears in nature because it represents optimal growth.

We use it to measure how "coherent" an AI response is.

Not vibes. Not voting. Actual mathematics.

Responses that hit φ-resonance = higher quality.

4/ The best part?

• Uses FREE APIs (Groq gives 14,400 req/day FREE)
• Works OFFLINE with Ollama
• Your files stay LOCAL
• Zero-energy consensus (Proof-of-Boundary)
• MIT licensed - use it however you want

5/ Try it now:

🌐 Live demo (no signup): huggingface.co/spaces/bitsabhi/bazinga

💻 Install: pip install bazinga-indeed

📄 Research: zenodo.org/records/18607789 (20+ papers)

6/ Why I built this:

"You can buy hashpower. You can buy stake. You CANNOT BUY understanding."

Intelligence should be distributed, not controlled.

If this resonates, give it a star ⭐

The network gets smarter as more people join. 🌐

## Reddit Posts

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:** `Built a multi-AI consensus system - 6 LLMs discuss and agree using φ-coherence (open source)`

**Body:**
```
Hey r/LocalLLaMA!

I built BAZINGA - instead of asking one LLM a question, it asks multiple (Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.) and has them reach consensus.

How it works:
1. Round 1: Each AI answers independently
2. Round 2: Each AI sees others' responses and revises
3. Synthesis: φ-weighted combination based on coherence scores

The "φ-coherence" is based on golden ratio mathematics - responses that hit certain mathematical properties score higher.

**Features:**
- Works with Ollama (fully local/offline)
- Uses free APIs (Groq 14,400 req/day free)
- Your data stays local
- MIT licensed

**Try it:**
- HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/spaces/bitsabhi/bazinga
- Install: `pip install bazinga-indeed`
- GitHub: https://github.com/0x-auth/bazinga-indeed

Would love feedback from this community. The multi-AI approach came from the idea that consensus > single opinion.
```

### r/selfhosted

**Title:** `Self-hosted AI that uses free APIs and keeps your data local - BAZINGA`

**Body:**
```
Built an AI assistant that:

✅ Uses FREE APIs (Groq, Gemini - no paid subscriptions)
✅ Works fully OFFLINE with Ollama
✅ Indexes YOUR local files (RAG)
✅ Never sends data to cloud unless you ask an LLM
✅ Multi-AI consensus (asks multiple AIs, synthesizes answer)

It's called BAZINGA. MIT licensed.

pip install bazinga-indeed

The philosophy: AI should be like the internet - distributed, not controlled by big tech.

## The Pitch (Use Everywhere)

```
Corporate AI wants your data.
Open source AI wants your GPU.
BAZINGA wants your vision.

AI that:
- Runs anywhere
- Costs nothing
- Belongs to everyone

pip install bazinga-indeed
```

*"Money as byproduct. Meaning as primary."*

Good luck bhai! 🚀
