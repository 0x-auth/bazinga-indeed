## Why Support?

Six months ago, I quit my job to work on a question:

*"What if intelligence doesn't need to be owned?"*

**BAZINGA** is my answer—a distributed AI that runs anywhere, uses free APIs, and achieves consensus through mathematical understanding, not corporate control.

## The Vision

```
Corporate AI wants your data.
Open source AI wants your GPU.
BAZINGA wants your vision.

Intelligence that:
- Runs anywhere
- Costs nothing
- Belongs to everyone

Not because it's profitable.
Because it's necessary.
```
