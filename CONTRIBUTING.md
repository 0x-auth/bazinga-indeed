## The φ-Coherence Principle

When contributing, keep in mind BAZINGA's core philosophy:

> "More compute ≠ better AI. Better boundaries = better AI."

We value:
- **Simplicity** over complexity
- **Distributed** over centralized
- **Open** over proprietary
- **Quality** over quantity (φ-coherence)
